# Program Overview 
Brian Sandstrom, June 2024, Stem 103 - Level 3 Create a Program using CSV files Part 1.\
A short Python script that analyzes a CSV file, edits data, and then makes a new CSV data file that contains the new data.
# Description
This Python script analyzes the CSV file 'security_incidents.csv' by adding an additional 'Status' column and 'Pending' default value rows.\
First, the CSV file is imported into the script.\
Then in the next two lines, the input and output CSV file names are specified.\
After this, the script reads the CSV file\
Next, the script defines what needs to be changed or added after reading the CVS data.\
The script will change or add the defined data and then save the data to a newly created 'security_incidents_modified.csv' file.\
Lastly, the script prints a statement saying, "Modified data saved to 'security_incidents_modified.csv'."
